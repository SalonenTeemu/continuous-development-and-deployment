LLM tools were used when doing this exercise.

The used LLM tool
- OpenAI ChatGPT

Motivation/reason to use LLM
- To speed up setup, troubleshoot issues, and help with documentation.
- For example, generating the simple Java application quickly, which I already knew how to do, but ChatGPT helped produce it faster.

How and why LLM helped
- Assisted in writing and refining the Java application code to keep it simple and with minimal dependencies.
- Helped debug errors faced in the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
- Assisted in improving the wording of the report.

What kind of mistakes LLM did
- Suggested outdated Docker images and GitLab CI syntax.
- Occasionally hallucinated, suggesting implementations unrelated to the exercise.

What were things that LLM was not able to provide
- Did not fully understand the whole pipeline context when I asked for help with specific issues, which sometimes led to incorrect or irrelevant answers.

I allow course staff to use this report in grading and use of it (after anonymization) for teaching development and research purposes.
