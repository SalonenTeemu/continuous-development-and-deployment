LLM tools were used when doing this exercise.

The used LLM tool
- OpenAI ChatGPT

Motivation/reason to use LLM
- To speed up setup, troubleshoot issues, and improve documentation.
- For example, to quickly generate a base version of the pipeline.

How and why LLM helped
- Quickly produced the basic monitoring service HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Provided guidance with NGINX configurations, as I was not too familiar with it from prior experience.
- Helped solve many technical issues described in the report.

What kind of mistakes LLM did
- Occasionally hallucinated, suggesting implementations unrelated to the project.
- Sometimes provided technically invalid or overly generic answers.

What were things that LLM was not able to provide
- Did not fully understand the whole project context when I asked for help with specific issues, which sometimes led to incorrect or irrelevant answers in the larger context.

I allow course staff to use this report in grading and use of it (after anonymization) for teaching development and research purposes.
