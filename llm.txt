LLM tools were used when doing this exercise.

The used LLM tool
- OpenAI ChatGPT

Motivation/reason to use LLM
- To speed up setup, solve issues, and help with documentation.
- For example, to quickly create Service1 (Python) and Service2 (Node.js), which I already knew I could do but could generate faster with ChatGPT.

How and why LLM helped
- Helped write and refine the code for each service. It was especially useful for helping with the Storage service implemented with Go language, which I had not used before.
- Helped with creating a multi-stage Dockerfile for the Storage service.
- Helped debug errors.
- Helped improve the wording of the report.

What kind of mistakes LLM did
- Gave incorrect Dockerfile syntax and suggested outdated images, which I had to fix manually.
- Sometimes hallucinated by suggesting implementations unrelated to the exercise.

What were things that LLM was not able to provide
- Did not fully understand the whole system context when I asked for help with specific issues, which sometimes led to incorrect answers.

I allow course staff to use this report in grading and use of it (after anonymization) for teaching development and research purposes.
