LLM tools were used when doing this exercise.

The used LLM tool
- OpenAI ChatGPT

Motivation/reason to use LLM
- To speed up setup, troubleshoot issues, and improve documentation.
- For example, to quickly generate a base version of the pipeline.

How and why LLM helped
- Assisted in writing the Ansible playbooks, as I had minimal prior experience with them.
- Helped debug errors faced in the GitLab CI/CD pipeline and the playbooks.
- Assisted in improving the wording of the report.

What kind of mistakes LLM did
- Occasionally hallucinated, suggesting implementations unrelated to the exercise.

What were things that LLM was not able to provide
- Did not fully understand the whole exercise context when I asked for help with specific issues, which sometimes led to incorrect or irrelevant answers.

I allow course staff to use this report in grading and use of it (after anonymization) for teaching development and research purposes.
